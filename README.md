## Purpose and Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is to create an ecommerce shop for a primary school that is targeted towards kids and families in the local area. The goal is to create this shop as an interactive fullstack website that allows customers to browse the available clubs, make bookings by credit card and if registered manage their orderhistory. These goals should be supported by providing a clean and easy to use website that allows seamless navigation and has a low bounce rate.

## Design process
Before laying out the project and creating an initial design market research was done. During this research phase the following questions were also acknowledged: 
* Do other schools provide this service?
* How do their stores look?
* What are typical design patterns used across stores?
* Which sites are appealing to me?
* Which kind of stores fit to my business idea? 

There are very few schools running this type of service or an ecommerce site so I looked across other sites for inspiration. Most retail sites fit the needs of the school site, exchanging products for clubs.


## Target group

The shop is targeted to parents and kids alike. The typical age of a shopper is estimated to be between 25 and 45 years but may be influenced by the child who may want to join a particular club. The families usually have 1-2 children in the age of 4 years up to 12 years. The clubs have a diverse spread of activities to entice as many children to participate in their preferred field. The income of the target group is an average mid to high household income. Furthermore the target group has a passion for engaging in extra curricular activites. 

## User Stories
